## Question 1
Your company is evaluating moving to Google Cloud. You will need to migrate your 3 TB on-premises `MySQL` databases to a managed database service in order to reduce administrative overhead. Minimal modification to the database is desired for the move. What managed database service would best meet this requirement?

- [ ] B. Cloud Datastore
- [ ] C. `Cloud SQL`
- [ ] D. Cloud `BigTable`

<details><summary>ANSWER</summary>
<b>

C. `Cloud SQL`

</b>

> `Cloud SQL` is the direct lift and shift option for existing `MySQL` workloads and requires minimal modification.
> Cloud `BigTable` is a NoSQL analytics database, and not a direct equivalent to a `MySQL` lift and shift operation.

## Question 12
You have a very large table with many columns that are not immediately relevant to your non-IT team members. You want to reduce the amount of irrelevant column data available in your table in order to keep from confusing your team members that need to run queries against it. What is a valid method of achieving this task?

- [ ] A. Create a copy of the table, and delete the unneeded columns.
- [ ] B. Assign `IAM` roles to only the columns that your staff needs access to.
- [ ] C. Use views to restrict the amount of data available, and have team members run their query against the view.
- [ ] D. Hide the unneeded columns from the table.

<details><summary>ANSWER</summary>
<b>

C. Use views to restrict the amount of data available, and have team members run their query against the view.

</b>

> You cannot assign `IAM` roles by columns.
> A view offers a virtual table that uses data pulled from a more restrictive query, giving less information to work with.

## Question 14
Choose two best practices for creating more efficient queries and saving costs.

- [ ] A. Save your biggest `JOINs` for last
- [ ] B. Avoid using `SELECT *` for column selection.
- [ ] C. Normalize your data when possible.
- [ ] D. Filter early and big with `WHERE` clauses

<details><summary>ANSWER</summary>
<b>

B. Avoid using `SELECT *` for column selection.
D. Filter early and big with `WHERE` clauses

</b>

> Since `BigQuery` is columnar, choosing unnecessary columns greatly increases query amounts.
> You want to de-normalize when possible, with nested/repeating columns.
> The more data you can filter out at the start, the more efficient your queries will be.
</details>
